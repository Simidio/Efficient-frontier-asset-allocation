# Efficient-frontier-asset-allocation
The Efficient Frontier Model is a fundamental concept in modern portfolio theory, developed by Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz in the 1950s. The model seeks to optimize the allocation of assets in a portfolio to achieve the highest possible return for a given level of risk or to minimize the risk for a desired level of return. It provides a quantitative framework to make rational investment decisions based on the trade-off between risk and return.

Implications for investors:

Risk Diversification: The model emphasizes the importance of diversifying investments across multiple assets to reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing potential returns.
Risk-Return Trade-off: The model illustrates that higher returns generally come with higher levels of risk. Investors must decide how much risk they are willing to accept to achieve their desired level of return.
Optimal Portfolio Selection: Investors can identify their optimal portfolios by selecting points on the efficient frontier that align with their risk preferences and return objectives.
Portfolio Rebalancing: As market conditions change, portfolio positions may drift away from the efficient frontier. Regular portfolio rebalancing is necessary to maintain the desired risk-return profile.

The Role of Correlation in Asset Allocation:

In the context of asset allocation and the construction of the Efficient Frontier, correlation plays a crucial role. Correlation measures the degree to which asset returns move together. Assets with low or negative correlations have the potential to reduce the overall portfolio risk when combined.
However, when the number of assets increases, adding more uncorrelated assets might not necessarily reduce the portfolio risk significantly. This is because the diversifiable risk diminishes as the portfolio becomes more diversified, and the remaining risk becomes more dominated by the systematic risk, which is not reducible through diversification.

The Importance of Volatility:

Additionally, the volatility of assets becomes critical when considering their inclusion in the portfolio. Highly volatile assets, even if uncorrelated, can increase the overall portfolio volatility.

The Efficient Frontier Model takes into account both diversifiable risk and systematic risk through correlation analysis. As the number of assets increases, careful consideration of the assets' volatilities becomes crucial to achieving an optimal risk-return trade-off in the portfolio. Effective asset allocation aims to strike a balance between diversification benefits and the impact of individual asset volatilities on the overall portfolio risk.
